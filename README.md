## 👨‍🔬 Experiment Now!

TODO

## 🏃 Getting Started

Using [`expo-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-cli) and `npx`, use `create-cubes` starter template:

```shell
npx expo init --template https://github.com/Trampoline-CX/create-cubes.git
```

### Installation

TODO

### Usage

After your project creation, there are some things worth mentioning to help you get started.

#### Expo

A Cubes project uses [Expo](https://expo.io/) (React Native), to prototype Apps on Web, Android and iOS with a unique code base. For Android and iOS, you can install the Expo App on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_CA) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/expo-client/id982107779) and then scan the barcode when starting the project with a Phone.

#### Start Project

Start the project using `yarn start`. You can also use `yarn web`, `yarn android` or `yarn ios` to directly start the project on the platform of your choice (make sure to connect a device first 😉).

After being started, saving changes in your code base will update the experience directly ⚡

#### AppProvider

This must be the Root component (or Cube 😉) of your App (see it in `App` file). By default, when creating a project, your `AppProvider` provides a very basic Navigation Schema (read more about Navigation [here](https://develop--5eebb872a669600022881133.chromatic.com/?path=/story/documentation-navigation--page)).

However, you can prototype a single screen if you want by not providing a Navigation Schema and embedding your Screen content directly in `AppProvider`.

```tsx
const MyScreen = () => (
  <AppProvider>
    <Screen>
      <TopBar />
      <Screen.Content>
        <DisplayText>See, No Navigation!</DisplayText>
      </Screen.Content>
    </Screen>
  </AppProvider>
)
```

## 📚 Documentation (Storybook)

All Cubes (components), along with their properties and usage, are documented in our [Storybook](https://develop--5eebb872a669600022881133.chromatic.com). There is also [extra documentation](https://develop--5eebb872a669600022881133.chromatic.com/?path=/story/documentation) there 🤫

If you don't know Storybook, it's a cool place where you can document your components and design guidelines. Learn more on [their website](https://storybook.js.org/)!
