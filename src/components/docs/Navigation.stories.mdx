# Navigation

Do you need some Navigation in your prototype? Here is how you can handle it!

```tsx
// Define your screens (not including each screen code for brevity)
const ScreenA = () => <Screen />
const ScreenB = () => <Screen />

export const App = () => (
  <AppProvider
    navigationSchema={{
      stack: [{ ScreenA }, { ScreenB }],
    }}
  />
)

// Now in each screen component (need to be function components), you can now do this to navigate.
const navigate = useNav()
navigate.to('ScreenB', { id: 'abc' }) // Navigate to ScreenB with the defined props
navigate.back() // Navigate back to ScreenA
```

## Navigation Schema

Navigation structure is provided by a `NavigationSchema`, provided to the `AppProvider` component. Navigation schemas are composed of 2 elements, Navigators and Screens.

A **Screen** structure is very straightforward:

```tsx
{
  screenName: MyScreenComponentName
}

// We recommend using JS object short syntax to reuse Component name as Screen Name, like so:
{
  MyScreenComponentName
}
```

As for the Navigators, Cubes supports 2 right now (`stack` and `switch`). Navigators can contain Screens and other Navigators. You can nest as many as you want!

Here is an example of a Navigation Schema for a Prototype App displaying 3 tabs:

1. Posts tabs, displaying blog posts. When clicking a Blog Post, we want to navigate on a Screen displaying the post details.
2. A Search Tab, for searching blog posts.
3. A Profile Tab, so the user can edit his profile and disconnect.

```tsx
const schema = {
  // The Switch navigator will contains tabs.
  switch: [
    {
      // Stack for having a nested PostDetail screen when clicking a Post.
      stack: [{ BlogPostsTab }, { PostDetail }],
    },
    { SearchTab },
    { ProfileTab },
  ],
  options: { backBehavior: 'tabs' },
}
```

> **Remark:** Options can be provided to Navigators via the `options` prop.

### Stack Navigator

As its name says, this Navigator stacks screens on top of each other. Very practical to handle hierarchical flows.

#### Options

<StackOptionsProps />

### Switch Navigator

This Navigator makes screens at the same hierarchical level. An example of this is a screen with a `BottomNavigationBar` with tabs to navigate between different screens.

<SwitchOptionsProps />

## For Typescript Users

When defining your Navigation Schema in Typescript, define it in a separate variable and don't forget to use `as const` after the object declaration. Here is the same example as on top written in Typescript:

```tsx
const schema = {
  // The Switch navigator will contains tabs.
  switch: [
    {
      // Stack for having a nested PostDetail screen when clicking a Post.
      stack: [{ BlogPostsTab }, { PostDetail }],
    },
    { SearchTab },
    { ProfileTab },
  ],
  options: { backBehavior: 'tabs' },
} as const
```

This way, you'll be able to have Screen Names and Props validation at compile time when using `useNav()` hook.

## Limitations

For now, the Navigation feature has several limitations:

- URLs are not cute right now, especially when nesting Navigators ðŸ¤­ This could be improved in the future!
- You can't navigate to screens nested deeply in another Navigator. Could be later improved.
